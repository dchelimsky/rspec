Story: Spec and test together

  As an RSpec adopter with existing Test::Unit tests
  I want to run a few specs alongside my existing Test::Unit tests
  So that I can experience a smooth, gradual migration path

  Scenario: Run with ruby
    Given the file test/spec_and_test_together.rb
    When I run it with the ruby interpreter
    Then the exit code should be 256

    And the stdout should match "Loaded suite"
    And the stdout should match "test_should_fail_with_assert(NeighborlyTest)"
    And the stdout should match "test_should_fail_with_should(NeighborlyTest)"
    And the stdout should match "4 tests, 2 assertions, 1 failures, 1 errors"

    And the stdout should match "Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError in 'spec should fail with assert'"
    And the stdout should match "'spec should fail with should' FAILED"
    And the stdout should match "4 examples, 2 failures"

  Scenario: Run with spec
    Given the file test/spec_and_test_together.rb
    When I run it with the spec script
    Then the exit code should be 256

#    And the stdout should match "Loaded suite"
#    And the stdout should match "test_should_fail_with_assert(NeighborlyTest)"
#    And the stdout should match "test_should_fail_with_should(NeighborlyTest)"
#    And the stdout should match "4 tests, 2 assertions, 1 failures, 1 errors"

    And the stdout should match "Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError in 'spec should fail with assert'"
    And the stdout should match "'spec should fail with should' FAILED"
    And the stdout should match "4 examples, 2 failures"
