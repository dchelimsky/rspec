Story: Nested example groups

  As an RSpec user
  I want to nest examples groups
  So that I can better organize my examples

  Scenario: Run with ruby
    Given the file spec/nested_group_spec.rb
    When I run it with the ruby interpreter -fs
    Then the stdout should match /Array when empty/
    And the stdout should match /Array with one item/
