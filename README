= RSpec - Behaviour Specification Framework for Ruby

RSpec is a behaviour specification framework for Ruby.  RSpec was created in
response to Dave Astels' article _A New Look at Test Driven Development_ which
can be read at: http://daveastels.com/index.php?p=5  RSpec is intended to
provide the features discussed in Dave's article.

RSpec was first explored by Steven Baker <srbaker@pobox.com> and Gabriel
Bauman <gbauman@gmail.com>, and has since received numerous contributions
from Dave himself as well as Aslak Hellesoy.
