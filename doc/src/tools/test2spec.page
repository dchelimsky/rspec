h2. Overview of test2spec

RSpec's test2spec command line tool translates existing Test::Unit classes to RSpec.  

Before you can use test2spec you must gem install ParseTree (and RubyInline).
RubyInline only works on systems that have a C compiler - i.e. most anything except Windows.

If you're stuck on Windows, ask a friend who has a POSIX system to translate your specs.
Once translated they can run on any Ruby platform (including Windows). After all, it's
just Ruby.

h2. The test2spec command line

<pre>
$ test2spec --help

{execute: ruby -I../lib ../bin/test2spec --help}
</pre>

A typical invocation might look like this:

<pre>
$ test2spec --template spec/test2spec.erb --specdir spec test
</pre>

Where spec/test2spec.erb contains the following:

<pre>
{includeFile: {filename: ../../../spec/test2spec.erb, processOutput: false}}
</pre>

If the test2spec.erb file doesn't exist you have to write it.

h2. Sample translation

<notextile>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Test::Unit (input)</td>
      <td>RSpec (output)</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ruby file="../test/spec/test_to_spec/testfiles/test_unit_api_test.rb"/>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ruby file="../spec/translated/test_unit_api_spec.rb"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</notextile>

h2. How good is the translator?

It's pretty good, but not 100%. It successfully translates most of RSpec's own Test::Unit tests.
All of the translated specs pass. Check it out:

"Results of RSpec's Test::Unit classes, after they have been translated with test2spec and run":rspec_specs.html

h2. What's translated?

test2spec only translates classes that extend from Test::Unit - and their methods. It will not bring over any 
code that isn't inside a Test::Unit class. This means that require statements at the top of your file, any 
non-Test::Unit classes (even if they are in in the same file as the test class) *will not be translated*.

We recommend that you manually write a spec_helper.rb file with require statements and put it at the top 
of your spec directory. Also, write a test2spec.erb file that will put a <tt>require</tt> of that file at 
the top of each translated spec. Use the <tt>--template</tt> option to specify this erb file when you run test2spec.

Sometimes, test classes have helper methods that don't start with test_ (and that are not setup or teardown).
These methods will be moved inside the setup block, and will also have any core Test::Unit assert_* methods
translated. (Non-Test::Unit core assert_ methods will not be translated.)

So, there is a fair chance that you will have to do some manual editing after test2spec has run. We're only
aiming to get most of the translation job done for you - not all of it.

If you're translating Rails tests, please refer to the RSpec on Rails page for more detail of what needs to 
be done.

h2. Troubleshooting

In some cases, test2spec will not be able to translate a test class. In that case, please submit a bug report
at RSpec's bug report system  along with some code so we can reproduce (and hopefully - fix) the problem. 
-Or better - submit a patch.

h2. Internals

The test2spec commandline 'runs' the tests with a special test runner - one that translates and writes out
the translations to disk instead of actually executing the tests.

The translation is done by the <tt>Test::Unit::TestCase#to_rspec</tt> method (which test2spec adds to all 
test classes). This method will load the parse tree for the class, transform that tree to an RSpec context 
and return the source code (using RubyToRuby).

test2spec is based directly on two other tools:

* "RubyToRuby":http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2005/02/rubytoruby.html
* "ParseTree":http://rubyforge.org/projects/parsetree/

In fact, it's based on a modified version of "George Moschovitis' RubyToRuby enhancement":http://dark.fhtr.org/ruby2ruby.rb
of "Ryan Davis' original RubyToRuby":http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2005/02/rubytoruby.html.

It has been modified to fix some subtle bugs that were not found by Gerorge's tests. The modified RubyToRuby
currently lives in RSpec's subversion repository.
