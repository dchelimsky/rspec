h2. Spec::Rails - Specifying Controllers

Controller Examples live in $RAILS_ROOT/spec/controllers/.

h2. Isolation from views

Spec::Rails has the ability to specify your controllers in complete
isolation from their related views. This allows you to spec your controllers
before the views even exist, and will keep the specs from failing when there
are errors in your views.

h2. Optional integration with views

If you prefer to integrate views (a la rails functional testing) you can by including
the keyword/commmand "integrate_views".

<ruby>
describe ArticlesController do
  integrate_views
  ...
end
</ruby>

When you integrate views in the controller specs, you can use any of the
expectations that are specific to views as well. Read about "View Examples":views.html
to learn more.

h2. Isolation from the database

We strongly recommend that you use RSpec's "mocking/stubbing framework":../../mocks/index.html
to intercept class level calls like <code>:find</code>, <code>:create</code> and
even <code>:new</code> to introduce mock instances instead of real active_record instances.

This allows you to focus your specs on the things that the controller does and not
worry about complex validations and relationships that should be described in
detail in the "Model Examples":models.html

<ruby>
account = mock_model(Account)
Account.should_receive(:find).with("37").and_return(account)
</ruby>

or

<ruby>
account = mock_model(Account)
Account.stub!(:find).and_return(account)
</ruby>

See "Mocks and Stubs":../../mocks/index.html for more information about the
built in mocking/stubbing framework.

h2. Response Expectations

These expectations will work whether in isolation or integration mode. See "Spec::Rails::Expectations":../../../rdoc-rails/index.html for details.

h3. response.should be_success

Passes if a status of 200 was returned. NOTE that in isolation mode, this will
always return true, so it's not that useful - but at least your specs won't break.

<ruby>
response.should be_success
</ruby>

h3. response.should be_redirect

Passes if a status of 300-399 was returned.

<ruby>
response.should be_redirect
</ruby>

h3. response.should render_template

<ruby>
get 'some_action'
response.should render_template("path/to/template/for/action")
</ruby>

h3. response.should have_text

<ruby>
get 'some_action'
response.should have_text("expected text")
</ruby>

h3. response.should redirect_to

<ruby>
get 'some_action'
response.should redirect_to(:action => 'other_action')
</ruby>

The following forms are supported:

<ruby>
response.should redirect_to(:action => 'other_action')
response.should redirect_to('path/to/local/redirect')
response.should redirect_to('http://test.host/some_controller/some_action')
response.should redirect_to('http://some.other.domain.com')
</ruby>

h2. Rendering Expectations

In addition to response.should render_template, described above, you can state more explicit rendering
expectations using controller.expects_render and controller.stubs_render. If you have an action that
renders a partial, for example:

<ruby>
controller.expects_render(:partial => 'person', :object => @person) #auto-verified
controller.stubs_render(:partial => 'person', :object => @person)   #not verified
</ruby>

%{color:red;font-weight:bold}WARNING%: expects_render and stubs_render, while very useful, act
differently from standard Message Expectations (a.k.a. mock expectations), which would never pass calls
through to the real object. This can be very confusing when there are failures if you're not aware of this
fact, because some calls will be passed through while others will not. This is especially confusing when
you use <code>stubs_render</code> because, as with all Method Stubs, you will get very little feedback
about what is going on.

h3. assigns, flash and session

Use these to access assigns, flash and session.

<ruby>
assigns[:key]
flash[:key]
session[:key]
</ruby>

h2. Routing Expectations

Specify the paths generated by custom routes.

<ruby>
route_for(:controller => "hello", :action => "world").should == "/hello/world"
</ruby>
