h3. Standard spec command

<pre>
script/spec path/to/directory/with/specs
script/spec path/to/individual_spec.rb
</pre>

h3. Run specs fast with &minus;&minus;drb (recommended)

Loading the entire Rails environment every time a spec is executed is quite slow.
To speed things up, Spec::Rails installs a daemon script that loads the local Rails app
and listens for incoming connections via DRb.

Open up a separate shell and start the spec server:

<pre>
script/spec_server
</pre>

Now you can run specs with the <tt>&minus;&minus;drb</tt> flag. 
If you're using Rake you should add <tt>&minus;&minus;drb</tt> to the <tt>spec/spec.opts</tt> file.

Note that there are some classes and modules that, by default, won't get reloaded
by Rails, which means they won't be reloaded by spec_server. There are a number 
of strategies available for coercing Rails to reload files every time in a given
environment. See the Rails documentation for more information.

h3. Running specs with Rake

Note that the rake tasks don't use the fast rails_spec command - it uses the
standard spec. Also note that it is pre-configured to run any file that ends
in "_spec", so you'll have to follow that convention.

Note that you can configure the options passed to RSpec by editing the <tt>spec/spec.opts</tt> file.

All specs (excluding plugins) can be run with...

<pre>
rake spec
rake spec:app
</pre>

All specs including plugins can be run with...

<pre>
rake spec:all
</pre>

You can also isolate Model, Controller, View, Helper or Plugin specs with...

<pre>
rake spec:models
rake spec:controllers
rake spec:views
rake spec:helpers
rake spec:plugins
</pre>

To see all the RSpec related tasks, run

<pre>
rake --tasks spec
</pre>
