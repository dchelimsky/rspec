h2. Spec::Rails - Installation - Quick Start

h4. Install

We strongly recommend you install RSpec and Spec::Rails as plugins (as opposed to relying on an RSpec gem).
See special instructions below if you want to install the HEAD of the trunk, or an older version.

h4. Installing the CURRENT release

Each release is mirrored in tags/CURRENT, so you can simply point at this to get the latest release.

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

If you're using svn for your project, install with -x.

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h4. No SVN?

For those of you working behind a firewall that prohibits svn access:

Go to http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=797, download the latest tarballs 
and unpack them in vendor/plugins. The directories will have
the version numbers in their names, so you'll need to remove them.

<pre>
#in vendor/plugins
tar zxvf rspec-{version: }.tgz
tar zxvf rspec_on_rails-{version: }.tgz
mv rspec-{version: } rspec
mv rspec_on_rails-{version: } rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h4. Installing a specific release

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/{svn_tag: }/rspec
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/{svn_tag: }/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

... or (using svn externals) ...

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/{svn_tag: }/rspec
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/{svn_tag: }/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h4. Bootstrap

Once the plugin is installed, you must bootstrap your Rails app with RSpec. Stand in the root of your Rails app and run:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec
</pre>

This will generate the various files needed to use RSpec with Rails.

h4. Run specs with rake ...

<pre>
rake spec
</pre>

h4. ... or run specs with scripts/spec

<pre>
ruby script/spec spec
</pre>

h2. Living on the Edge

If you prefer to live dangerously you can get the HEAD of the trunk instead of installing from a tag.

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

If your own project is in Subversion and you'd like Spec::Rails to always follow HEAD, install with -x:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install -x http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

Or, if you prefer "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/:

<pre>
piston import http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec vendor/plugins/rspec
piston import http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

One note about using 'edge spec'. If you're choosing to do this, you probably
like to use edge rails as well. If you do this, you have chosen to work with two moving targets,
which is nuts. We do it too, so you're not alone. But please don't expect that edge spec is
always going to support the latest changes in edge rails. And when it doesn't, a patch
would be just lovely!

h2. Releases 0.8.x to 0.9.x (not really recommended at this point)

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/rspec
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h2. Releases < 0.7.5 (REALLY NOT recommended at this point)

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/rspec
ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/vendor/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>
