title: Method Stubs

h2. Method Stubs

In addition to the more standard <a href="mocks.html">Mock Object framework</a>, RSpec also supports
stubbing return values to messages on any object (including Classes and mocks!). Stubs do not support any
arguments. You simply set up a return value and forget about it. If you need more control, take a
look at <a href="partial_mocks.html">partial mocking</a>.

The main difference between a stub and a mock is that mocks verify interactions that you
expect, while stubs just sit there and return values.

h3. Setting an explicit return value

This is the simplest (and recommended) approach to stubbing.

<ruby>
my_instance.stub!(:msg).and_return(value)
MyClass.stub!(:msg).and_return(value)
</ruby>

h3. Calculating a return value

<ruby>
my_instance.stub!(:msg).and_return { ... }
MyClass.stub!(:msg).and_return { ... }
</ruby>

While this is possible, it is generally to be avoided. Calculating a value to return defeats
the declarative nature of stubs.

h3. Multiple return values

<ruby>
my_instance.stub!(:msg).and_return("1",2)
MyClass.stub!(:msg).and_return("1",2)
</ruby>

This will return "1" the first time it is called and 2 every subsequent call. Like
calculated return values, this is a little un-stubby, but it can be a handy feature
once in a while.

h3. Mixing stubs and mock messages

In some cases it can be helpful to stub a default return value, but set a mock expectation
for a specific set of args. For example:

<ruby>
A.stub!(:msg).and_return(:default_value)
A.should_receive(:msg).with(:arg).and_return(:special_value)
A.msg
=> :default_value
A.msg(:any_other_arg)
=> :default_value
A.msg(:arg)
=> :special_value
A.msg(:any_other_other_arg)
=> :default_value
A.msg
=> :default_value
</ruby>
