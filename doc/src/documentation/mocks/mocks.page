h2. Mock Objects

RSpec contains a tightly integrated Mock Object framework.

h3. Creating a mock

<ruby>
my_mock = mock(<name>)
</ruby>

This creates a new mock with the given <code>name</code> (a string) and registers it. 
When the specification finishes, all registered mocks are verified.

<ruby>
my_mock = mock(<name>, <options>)
</ruby>

As above, but allows you to specific options to tweak the mock's behaviour.
The <code>options</code> argument is a hash. Currently the only supported option
is <code>:null_object</code>. Setting this to true instructs the mock to ignore 
(quietly consume) any messages it hasn't been told to expect - and return itself.  i.e.

<ruby>
my_mock = mock("blah", :null_object => true)
</ruby>

h3. Expecting Messages

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(<message>)
</ruby>

The <code>message</code> argument is a symbol that is the name of a message 
that you want the mock to expect.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_not_receive(:msg)
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is ever received.
This is equivalent to not specifying the reception of :msg,
but it's more declarative and useful for humans.

h3. Expecting Arguments

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(<args>)
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.with(<args>)
</ruby>

for example: 

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(1, 2, 3)
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.with(1, 2, 3)
</ruby>

The <code>args</code> argument is a series of arguments (e.g. 1, 2, 3) that are 
expected to be passed as arguments to the associated message.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(:no_args)
</ruby>

The message (<code>msg</code>) is expected to be passed no arguments.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(:any_args)
</ruby>

Any arguments (and any number of arguments) are to be accepted. This includes 
cases where no arguments are provided. *This is the default when no <code>with()</code> 
clause is specified.*  Even so, sometimes you want to be explicit about it.

h3. Argument Constraints

Constraints can be placed on individual arguments which are looser than value 
equivalence (as above).

h4. :anything

accepts any value for this argument, e.g.:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(1, :anything, "A")
</ruby>

h4. :numeric

accepts any numeric value for this argument, e.g.:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(a, :numeric, "b")
</ruby>

h4. :boolean

accepts a boolean value for this argument, e.g.:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(a, :boolean, "b")
</ruby>

h4. :string

accepts any string for this argument, e.g.:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(a, :string, "b")
</ruby>
  
h4. duck_type(message(s))

accepts any object that responds to the prescribed message(s), e.g.:

<ruby>
#accepts a Fixnum for the second arg
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(a, duck_type(:abs, :div), "b") 
</ruby>

h4. /regular expressions/ 

matches a String against a regular expression. If a regular expression is submitted, compares the two expressions for equality

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(/bcd/)

my_mock.msg "abcde" #passes 
my_mock.msg /bcd/ #passes 
my_mock.msg "def" #fails
my_mock.msg /bcde/ #fails
</ruby>

h3. Receive Counts

The implicit expectation is that the message passed to <code>should_receive</code> will
be called once. You can make the expected counts explicit using the following:

h4. Precise Counts

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is never received, or it is received more than once.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).twice
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received anything but two times.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).exactly(n).times
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received anything but <code>n</code> times.

h4. Relative Counts - at_least

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_least(:once)
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is never received.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_least(:twice)
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is never received or is received only once.

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_least(n).times
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received fewer than <code>n</code> times.

h4. Relative Counts - at_most

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_most(:once)
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received more than once (does not raise if message is never receieved).

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_most(:twice)
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received more than twice (does not raise if message is never receieved).

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).at_most(n).times
</ruby>

An exception is raised if the message is received more than <code>n</code> times (does not raise if message is never receieved).

h4. Explicitly Imprecise Counts

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).any_number_of_times
</ruby>

The message can be received 0 or more times.

h3. Return Values

h4. Single return value

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.and_return(<value>)
</ruby>

Each time the expected message is received, <code>value</code> will be returned as the result.

h4. Consecutive return values

<ruby>
and_return(<value-1>, <value-2>, ..., <value-n>)
</ruby>

When the expected message is received, <code>value-i</code> will be returned as
the result for the ith reception of the message. After the message has been
received <code>i</code> times, <code>value-n</code> is returned for all
subsequent receives.  

h4. Computed return value

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.and_return {...} 
</ruby>

When the expected message is received, the result of evaluating the supplied
block will be returned as the result. The block is passed any arguments passed
as arguments of the message. This capability can be used to compute return 
values based on the arguments.  For example:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).with(:numeric, :numeric) once.and_return {|a, b| a + b}
</ruby>

h3. Raising and Throwing

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.and_raise(<exception>)
</ruby>

Tells the mock to raise an exception instead of returning a value.
&lt;exception> may be any Exception class, an instance of
any Exception class, or a String (in which case a RuntimeError will be raised
with that String as its message).

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.and_throw(<symbol>) 
</ruby>

Tells the mock to throw a symbol instead of returning a value.

h3. Yielding

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg).once.and_yield([<value-1>, <value-2>, ..., <value-n>])
</ruby>

When the expected message is received, the mock will yield the values to the passed block.

h3. Ordering

There are times when you want to specify the order of messages sent to a mock.
It shouldn't be the case very often, but it can be handy at times. 

Labeling expectations as being ordered is done by the <code>ordered</code> call:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:flip).once.ordered
my_mock.should_receive(:flop).once.ordered
</ruby>

If the send of <code>flop</code> is seen before <code>flip</code> the specification will fail.

Of course, chains of ordered expectations can be set up:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:one).ordered
my_mock.should_receive(:two).ordered
my_mock.should_receive(:three).ordered
</ruby>

The expected order is the order in which the expectations are declared.

Order-independent expectations can be set anywhere in the expectation sequence, in any order.  
Only the order of expectations tagged with the <code>ordered</code> call is significant.  
Likewise, calls to order-independent methods can be made in any order, even interspersed with 
calls to order-dependent methods.  For example:

<ruby>
  my_mock.should_receive(:zero)
  my_mock.should_receive(:one).ordered
  my_mock.should_receive(:two).ordered
  my_mock.should_receive(:one_and_a_half)

  # This will pass:
  my_mock.one
  my_mock.one_and_a_half
  my_mock.zero
  my_mock.two
</ruby>

h3. Arbitrary Handling of Received Messages

You can supply a block to a message expectation. When the message is received
by the mock, the block is passed any arguments and evaluated. The result is
the return value of the block. For example:

<ruby>
my_mock.should_receive(:msg) { |a, b| 
  a.should_be true
  b.should_not_contain('mice')
  "Chunky bacon!"
}
</ruby>

This allows arbitrary argument validation and result computation.  It's handy and kind of cool to be able to 
do this, but it is advised to not use this form in most situations.  Mocks should not be functional.  
They should be completely declarative.  That said, it's sometimes useful to give them some minimal behaviour.
