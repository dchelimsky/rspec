h2. Mock Objects

Mock objects are imitation objects that give you declarative control over
their behaviour in the course of the execution of an example. Defining
"message expectations":message_expectations.html and "method stubs":stubs.html
on mock objects allows you to specify how one object collaborates with others
before those other objects exist.

You can also use mock objects to isolate your examples from services that are
complex to set up or expensive to run, thereby keeping your suite of examples
running quickly.

RSpec ships with a built-in mock object framework that lets you create
mock objects in your examples or add mock-object-like behaviour to your
existing objects.

h3. Creating a mock object

You create a mock object with the <code>mock</code> method:

<ruby>
my_mock = mock(<name>)
</ruby>

This creates a new mock with the given <code>name</code> (a string) and registers it. 
When the example finishes, all registered mocks are verified.

<ruby>
my_mock = mock(<name>, <stubs_and_options>)
</ruby>

As above, but allows you to set stub return values for specific messages and
options that tweak the mock's behaviour. Currently the only supported option
is <code>:null_object</code>. Setting this to true instructs the mock to
ignore (quietly consume) any messages it hasn't been told to expect - and
return itself.

<ruby>
my_mock = mock("blah", :null_object => true)
</ruby>
