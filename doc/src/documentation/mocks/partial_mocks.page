h2. Mock Object behaviour on Real Objects

RSpec allows you to add mock object behaviour to real objects, so you can set
"message expectations":message_expectations.html and "method stubs":stubs.html
on any object in your system.

One common use of this support is isolating examples from ActiveRecord (and
therefore the database) in Ruby on Rails examples.

<ruby>
MyModel.should_receive(:find).with(id).and_return(@mock_model_instance)
</ruby>

Controlling the behaviour of the class level methods (for example, having them
return a mock object instead of a real instance of the model class) allows you
to describe your controllers and views in isolation from the instance level
logic of your model classes. This means that you can change the validation
rules for a model, for example, and drive that in the model examples without
affecting the controller and view examples.

This also helps to keep the context of your example completely in view (no
having to look at fixtures/xyz.yml to understand what's going on).
