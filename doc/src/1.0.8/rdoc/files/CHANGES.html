      <h2>Version 1.0.8</h2>
<p>
Another bugfix release - this time to resolve the version mismatch
</p>
<h2>Version 1.0.7</h2>
<p>
Quick bugfix release to ensure that you don&#8216;t have to have the rspec
gem installed in order to use autotest with rspec_on_rails.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed [13015] autotest gives failure in &#8216;spec_command&#8217; after
upgrade 1.0.5 to 1.0.6

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 1.0.6</h2>
<p>
The &quot;holy cow, batman, it&#8216;s been a long time since we released
and there are a ton of bug fixes, patches and even new features&quot;
release.
</p>
<p>
Warning: Spec::Rails users: In fixing 11508, we&#8216;ve removed the
raise_controller_errors method. As long as you follow the upgrade
instructions and run &#8216;script/generate rspec&#8217; you&#8216;ll be
fine, but if you skip this step you need to manually go into spec_helper.rb
and remove the call to that method (if present - it might not be if you
haven&#8216;t upgraded in a while).
</p>
<p>
Warning: Implementors of custom formatters. Formatters will now be sent an
Example object instead of just a <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a> for example_started,
example_passed and example_failed. In certain scenarios (Spec::Ui with
Spec::Distributed), the formatter must ask the Example for its sequence
number instead of keeping track of a sequence number internal to the
formatter. Most of you shouldn&#8216;t need to upgrade your formatters
though - the Example#to_s method returns the example name/description, so
you should be able to use the passed Example instance as if it were a <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied [12986] <a href="../classes/Autotest.html">Autotest</a> Specs +
Refactoring (Patch from Scott Tayler)

</li>
<li>Added a close method to formatters, which allows them to gracefully close

specs (Patch from Jens Krämer)

</li>
<li>Applied [12817] Cannot include same shared behaviour when required with
absolute paths (Patch from Ian Leitch)

from Matthijs Langenberg)

&#8216;should_receive&#8217; methods for ApplicationController (Patch from

the Formatter (Patch from Bob Cotton)

<li>Applied [12237] (tiny) added full path to mate in switch_command (Patch
from Carl Porth)

href="../classes/String.html">String</a> for certain methods

</li>
<li>All <a href="../classes/Spec/Rake/SpecTask.html">Spec::Rake::SpecTask</a>
attributes can now be procs, which allows for lazy evaluation.

</li>
<li>Changed the Spec::Ui interfaces slightly. See examples.

</li>
<li>Applied [12174] mishandling of paths with spaces in spec_mate
switch_command (Patch from Carl Porth)

<li>Pending blocks that now pass are rendered blue

</li>
<li>New behaviour for after: If an after block raises an error, the other ones
will still run instead of bailing at the first.

</li>
<li>Made it possible to run spec from RSpec.tmbundle with &#8212;drb against a
Rails spec_server.

<p>
This is a quick maintenance release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added some website love

</li>
<li>Fixed [10542] reverse predicate matcher syntax

</li>
<li>Added a spec:translate Rake task to make 0.9 translation easier with <a
href="../classes/Spec.html">Spec</a>:Rails

</li>
<li>Better translation of should_redirect_to

</li>
<li>Fixed &#8212;colour support for Windows. This is a regression that was
introduced in 0.9.1

</li>
<li>Applied [10460] Make SpecRunner easier to instantiate without using
commandline args

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.9.1</h2>
<p>
This release introduces describe and it (aliased as context and specify for
backwards compatibility). This allows you to express specs like this:
</p>
<pre>
  describe SomeClass do # Creates a Behaviour
    it &quot;should do something&quot; do # Creates an Example
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The command line features four new options that give you more control over
what specs are being run and in what order. This can be used to verify that
your specs are independent (by running in opposite order with
&#8212;reverse). It can also be used to cut down feedback time by running
the most recently modified specs first (&#8212;loadby mtime
&#8212;reverse).
</p>
<p>
Further, &#8212;example replaces the old &#8212;spec option, and it can now
take a file name of spec names as an alternative to just a spec name. The
&#8212;format failing_examples:file.txt option allows you to output an
&#8212;example compatible file, which makes it possible to only rerun the
specs that failed in the last run. Spec::Rails uses all of these four
options by default to optimise your RSpec experience.
</p>
<p>
There is now a simple configuration model. For Spec::Rails, you do
something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'
  end
</pre>
<p>
You can now use mocha or flexmock with RSpec if you prefer either to
RSpec&#8216;s own mock framework. Just put this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :mocha
  end
</pre>
<p>
or this:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :flexmock
  end
</pre>
<p>
in a file that is loaded before your specs. You can also configure included
modules and predicate_matchers:
</p>
<pre>
  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include SomeModule
    config.predicate_matchers[:does_something?] = :do_something
  end
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="../classes/Spec/DSL/Behaviour.html">Spec::DSL::Behaviour</a>
for more on predicate_matchers
</p>

(See explanation in &#8212;help)

</li>
<li>Several &#8212;format options may be specified to output several formats in
one run.

</li>
<li>The &#8212;out option is gone. Use &#8212;format html:path/to/my.html
instead (or similar).

</li>
<li>Spec::Runner::Formatter::BaseTextFormatter#initialize only takes one
argument - an IO. dry_run and color are setters.

</li>

</p>
<h2>Version 0.8.1</h2>
<p>
Quick &quot;in house&quot; bug-fix
</p>
<h2>Version 0.8.0</h2>
<p>
This release introduces a new approach to handling expectations using
Expression Matchers.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/upgrade.html">Upgrade</a>, <a
href="../classes/Spec/Expectations.html">Spec::Expectations</a>, <a
href="../classes/Spec/Matchers.html">Spec::Matchers</a> and RELEASE-PLAN
for more info.
</p>
<p>
This release also improves the spec command line by adding DRb support and
making it possible to store command line options in a file. This means a
more flexible RSpec experience with Rails, Rake and editor plugins like
TextMate.
</p>
<p>
It also sports myriad new features, bug fixes, patches and general

<h2>Version 0.7.0</h2>
<p>
This is the &quot;Grow up and eat your own dog food release&quot;. RSpec is
now used on itself and we&#8216;re no longer using <a
href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> to test it. Although, we
are still extending <a href="../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> for
the rails plugin (indirectly - through ZenTest)
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE IS NOT 100% BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE TO 0.6.x
</p>
<p>
There are a few changes that will require that you change your existing
specs.
</p>
<p>
RSpec now handles equality exactly like ruby does:
</p>
<p>
# actual.should_equal(expected) will pass if actual.equal?(expected)
returns true # actual.should eql(expected) will pass if
actual.eql?(expected) returns true # actual.should == expected will pass if
actual == expected) returns true
</p>
<p>
At the high level, eql? implies equivalence, while equal? implies object
identity. For more information on how ruby deals w/ equality, you should do
this:
</p>
<p>
ri equal?
</p>
<p>
or look at this:
</p>
<p>
<a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057">www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, we left in should_be as a synonym for should_equal, so the only specs
that should break are the ones using should_equal (which used to use
<tt>==</tt> instead of <tt>.equal?</tt>).
</p>
<p>
Lastly, should_be used to handle true and false differently from any other
values. We&#8216;ve removed this special handling, so now actual.should_be
true will fail for any value other than true (it used to pass for any
non-nil, non-false value), and actual.should_be false will fail for any
value other than false (it used to pass for nil or false).
</p>
<p>
Here&#8216;s what you&#8216;ll need to do to update your specs: # search
for &quot;should_equal&quot; and replace with &quot;should_eql&quot; # run
specs
</p>
<p>
If any specs still fail, they are probably related to should be_true or
should_be_false using non-boolean values. Those you&#8216;ll just have to
inspect manually and adjust appropriately (sorry!).
